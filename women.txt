-After having delicious food, we'll worship together, learn together, laugh together, pray for and encourage one another.
-Anne will be sharing about our identity as children of God -- we may know we are God's children, but do we live it?
-If you came last time and got a notebook, please remember to bring it.
We look forward to seeing you there!
